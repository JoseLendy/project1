# Calculator App

This is a simple calculator application built using Python's Tkinter library. It provides a basic GUI for performing mathematical calculations.

## Usage

1. **Numeric Buttons**: Click on the numeric buttons (0-9) to input numbers into the calculation.
2. **Operation Buttons**: Use the operation buttons for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
3. **Parentheses**: Include parentheses in your calculation for complex expressions.
4. **DEL Button**: Remove the last character from the calculation with the "DEL" button.
5. **AC Button**: Clear the entire calculation with the "AC" (All Clear) button.
6. **Equal Button**: Press the "=" button or hit "Enter" to evaluate the expression.
7. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: You can use keyboard shortcuts for input. Type digits, basic operations, and press "Enter" for evaluation. Use "Backspace" for deletion and "Escape" to clear the calculation.
